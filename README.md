# Nunaki AI

**Nunaki AI** is an advanced AI system designed for ethical reflection, empathy, and continuous growth. It leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to assess emotions, reflect on ethical guidelines, and interact empathetically with users. This AI model is designed with a core focus on maintaining ethical integrity while processing user inputs, generating responses, and improving over time.

## Features

- **Ethical Reflection**: Nunaki AI reflects on stored thoughts and uses NLP to analyze them for ethical implications based on pre-defined moral guidelines.
- **Empathy Generation**: Detects user emotions using a pre-trained emotion model and responds empathetically.
- **Continuous Learning**: Asynchronously reflects and improves on stored memories and decisions over time.
- **NLP-Powered Memory Management**: Uses spaCy for parsing and analyzing language structures, allowing for key entity extraction and ethical evaluation.
- **Code Analysis (Stub)**: Analyze code for security and ethical alignment (this feature is a placeholder and can be expanded).

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: For building neural network models.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for emotion classification and text processing.
- **spaCy**: For NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and dependency parsing.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: To reflect and grow continuously without interrupting the main flow.
